**#Financial Fraud Detection and Analytics Project**


Welcome to the **Financial Fraud Detection and Analytics Project** repository!
This project showcases a robust data warehousing and analytics solution tailored for financial transaction analysis, with a focus on detecting fraudulent activities. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering, analytics, and fraud detection to empower data-driven decision-making.

##Project Overview
This project builds a modern data warehouse to consolidate and analyze financial transaction datasets, enabling the detection of fraudulent activities and generating actionable insights. By leveraging advanced data engineering techniques and SQL-based analytics, the project aims to uncover patterns of fraud, assess transaction behaviors, and provide stakeholders with critical financial metrics.

###Project Requirements

Building a modern Data Warehouse (Data Engineering).

####Objectives

Develop a scalable data warehouse using SQL Server to integrate financial transaction data, enabling efficient fraud detection and analytical reporting.

####Specifications

**Data Sources**: Import data from five datasets provided as CSV files:

**cards_data**: Credit/debit card details.
**mcc_codes**: Merchant Category Codes for transaction categorization.
**train_fraud_labels**: Labeled dataset indicating fraudulent transactions.
**transactions_data**: Detailed transaction records.
**users_data**: User profile information.

**Data Quality**: Perform data cleansing to address inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates to ensure reliable analysis.
**Integration**: Combine all datasets into a cohesive, user-friendly data model optimized for fraud detection and analytical queries.
**Script**: Focus on processing the latest dataset; historical data archiving is not required.
**Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation of the data model, including schema descriptions, to support business stakeholders and analytics teams.


##BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

###Objectives

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver insights into:
**Fraud Detection**: Identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent transactions.
**Transaction Behavior**: Analyze user spending patterns and merchant interactions.
**Financial Trends**: Track key financial metrics to inform business strategies.

**These insights enable stakeholders to proactively mitigate fraud risks and make informed financial decisions.**

###Key Metrics
•	Fraud detection rates and false positives.
•	Transaction volume and value by merchant category.
•	User behavior trends across demographics.
•	High-risk transaction patterns.

###Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
SQL Server (or compatible database system)
Python (for data preprocessing, if applicable)
SQL client (e.g., SSMS) for querying
CSV file handling tools (e.g., Pandas, Excel)

Installation

Clone this repository:bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-fraud-detection.git

Import the provided CSV datasets (cards_data, mcc_codes, train_fraud_labels, transactions_data, users_data) into your SQL Server environment.
Run the SQL scripts in the scripts/ directory to create the data warehouse schema and load the data.
Execute the analytics queries in the analytics/ directory to generate insights.

####Usage
**Data Warehouse Setup**:
Use the scripts in scripts/ to create tables, perform ETL processes, and integrate the five datasets.
Refer to docs/data_model.md for a detailed schema description.

**Fraud Detection and Analytics**:
Run the SQL queries in analytics/ to generate fraud detection reports and financial insights.
Example queries include identifying high-risk transactions, analyzing merchant category trends, and profiling user behaviors.

**Visualization**:
Export query results to visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) for interactive dashboards.
